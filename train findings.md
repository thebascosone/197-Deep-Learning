***Notes for the next runs***

Fourth Run (giddy-wildflower-13) is very similar to Second Run but slightly better
- increase eta_min to 0.05
- add 5 warmup epochs with linear method and decay of 0.1
- [not priority] increase eta_min to 0.08, set initial LR to 0.12, and use exponential decay scheduler
- [not priority] increase learning rate to 0.12 and weight decay to 0.00007
